            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I'm <span>Rhenea.</span>  <br />
                You can call me by either name! <br /><br />
                I'm a Public Health Nurse currently working as an Outbreak Management Team Lead for Toronto Public Health. <br /><br />
                I'm hoping to be an Epidemiologist one day with the province of Ontario! <br /><br />
                In the mean time, I'm broadening my skills in various languages and data analytics with some hobby Web Development on the side.
